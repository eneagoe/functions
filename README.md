# Functional

This library facilitates writing code in a more functional style inside Ruby.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'functional'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install functional

## Usage

The library provides two different styles.
One style builds on Lambda's and another style uses meta-programming.
The lambda style is a bit more pure but is currently just a bit slower in performance.
